    <hr>

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p>The 1st annual Christmahanakwanzika Pub Crawl is set to go down Friday December 11, 2015 at 8:00 pm in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. The first annual Master's pub crawl was a success and people were asking for an encore, and we are going to deliver. The Christmahanakwanzika Pub Crawl will take place over six bars, in which the route will be display here shortly. We have created shirts for the event.  However, Joe lives off a teacher salary and Chad just got out of school and is looking for work, and as much as we would love to buy everyone a shirt who attends we are unable to. We are poor. If you are interested in a shirt please let Joe or Chad know before DATE. Or sign up on the site.    </p>

      <p> Safety is very important to us and a top priority. First off, we are all about having a good time and hope that each and everyone of you who attends does so.  Yet, if you plan to drink any alcohol, we ask that you do not drive. You are very important to us and would hate for this event to be ruined by an unfortunate event. We have constructed a few resources to help.<br>
         <br>Please use the following resources to your right as needed.
